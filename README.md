# House-Price-Prediction
In this project I have tried to create multiple algorithms that are able to be tested and provide results for the prediction of the house price in a couple of different datasets while looking at the features that influence it the most. As such in the main side is the different models trained on a main file Housing.csv and once found the best ones - RF, Catboost and Linear Regression - these were deploed on two datasets one from us and the other from australia.

Feature importance and correlation matrixes where also done in order to see which of the feature have the most importance in determining the price
