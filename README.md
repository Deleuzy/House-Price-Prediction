# House-Price-Prediction
In this project I have tried to create multiple algorithms that are able to be tested and provide results for the prediction of the house price in a couple of different datasets while looking at the features that influence it the most.

I initially trialed some algorithms with the Housing.csv file to see which ones will work best then I have also tested them on an additional file named new_dataset where a similar type of data was there and see how is it run there and then at the end I have done my final testing on the housing_us and housing_australia files to see what type of results I get there and also see which features matter most between the two differnet geographical and cultural zones
